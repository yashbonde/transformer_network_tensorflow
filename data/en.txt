Prayers.  Saskatchewan Saskatoon-Tragic Deaths in Aboriginal Community Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :Honourable senators, today is a sad day for all Canadians, especially the aboriginal communities of Canada. Within the past month, two aboriginal men froze to death on the outskirts of the city of Saskatoon in Saskatchewan. These tragedies would have gone unnoticed had not an aboriginal man survived and come forward to explain how these two men came to be outside the city limits of Saskatoon in sub-zero temperatures.  According to newspaper reports, the Saskatoon police force is in the habit of taking aboriginal people who, in their opinion, have had too much to drink, drive them to this area, dump them out, and leave them to walk back to town. According to one newspaper report, this practice has been going on for years.  The Saskatoon police chief has apologized. Will this apology help the families of the men who died? The RCMP will investigate. Will this be an unbiased investigation? The Federation of Saskatchewan Chiefs wants an independent inquiry. Will anyone listen?  We, as Canadians, pride ourselves on being the best country in the world in which to live, and all the while my people, the Métis, the First Nations

Prayers.  Fisheries and Oceans Maritime Provinces-Supreme Court Decision Upholding Native Fishing Rights Hon. Lowell Murray :Honourable senators, I ask for your indulgence while I say a word about the situation in the East Coast fishery. The latest development - and I confess that I am relying almost exclusively on media reports this morning - is that the chiefs appear to have renounced the 30-day moratorium to which they had earlier agreed.  Again, relying on media reports of the debate in another place last night, it appears that the Minister of Fisheries, Mr. Dhaliwal, was caught unaware by this development, as indeed the government had been caught flat-footed some four weeks ago by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.  Far be it from me, honourable senators, to pose as a legal expert, still less as an interpreter of the Supreme Court of Canada decision, but the assertion by one of the chiefs this morning that they reserve the right to regulate their own fishery is, in my humble opinion, contrary to the judgment brought down by the Supreme Court of Canada. The majority decision written by Mr. Justice Binnie refers to: ...the narrow ambit and extent of the treaty right.  He writes: The treaty right is a regulated right and can be contained by regulation within its proper limits. Catch limits that could reasonably be expected to produce a moderate livelihood for individual Mi'kmaq families at present-day standards can be established by regulation and enforced without violating the treaty right. Such regulations would accommodate the treaty and would not constitute an infringement that would have to be justified under the Badger standard.  Honourable senators, it seems to me that those statements constitute an invitation on the part of the Suprem

Prayers.  Canadian Heritage Status of Plans for Proposed New War Museum Hon. Lowell Murray :Honourable senators, plans for a new Canadian War Museum are said to be on hold. A report in last Friday's Globe and Mail states that funding for the proposed new museum is low on the government's list of spending priorities because the project has attracted little interest either from the public or from members of Parliament.  An advisory committee is apparently trying to raise private donations for the project. However, potential donors are said to be reluctant to contribute until they know the extent of the government's commitment. On that question, a spokesperson for Heritage Minister Sheila Copps is quoted as saying that no final decision has been made.  This raises a more fundamental question. Why on earth is the Government of Canada passing the hat to finance a new War Museum? This is a pretty cheap way to treat an institution created

Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :Honourable senators, on Saturday night, His Excellency Keizo Obuchi, Prime Minister of Japan, fell ill and was admitted to hospital. As honourable senators are aware, Prime Minister Obuchi suffered a stroke and is in a coma. I know all honourable senators join me in offering sympathy to the Japanese people and their government. I have spoken to Ambassador Katsuhisa Uchida to convey these sentiments, which have been acknowledged by Acting Prime Minister Aoki. I extend our sympathy to His Excellency's family, especially his wife, Chizuko Obuchi, the members of the diet and of his party.  We wish His Excellency a return to health, as the Japanese people have been well served by his invaluable talents as a political leader. Prime Minister Obuchi's political career and his long-standing interest in foreign relations brought him into frequent contact with Canada. I met with the then foreign minister Obuchi as Minister Axworthy's envoy to Japan to encourage Japan's participation in the convention against anti-personnel mines. Minister Obuchi not only received me warmly, but also actively encouraged his government to sign the convention. He was in Ottawa in December 1997 to sign the conv

Prayers.  In Vitro Maturation Hon. Lucie Pépin :Honourable senators, three weeks ago researchers at McGill University reported that they had helped several couples to conceive babies, even twins, using a new and revolutionary method. This method, which facilitates the transformation of a woman's immature eggs into embryos is called in vitro maturation. IVM is an offshoot of in vitro fertilization, which revolutionized the treatment of infertility in the 1970s. In vitro maturation differs from in vitro fertilization in that, with IVM, the egg is brought to maturation and then fertilized outside the uterus of the mother while, with in vitro fertilization, the already matured egg is fertilized in the laboratory.  IVM was developed in South Korea and Australia in the early 1990s, for women whose eggs did not mature naturally. Until recently, the success rate with IVM was low, but Dr. Seang Lin Tan, Director of the McGill University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology has changed all that. By successfully bringing eggs to maturity outs

Today, with you, I pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of men and women who ensure that our economy keeps moving. By air, road, rail, and water, these individuals toil around the clock, moving people and goods in a never-ending cycle of mobility.  We hear much about the Internet and so-called "death of distance" through telecommunications technology, but our vast geography here in Canada demands superior physical links. Our road and rail infrastructure, our harbours and airports keep us connected. They ensure that all of us can travel as well as enjoy consumer products from home and abroad. Close to half a million p

Marisa Ferretti Barth :Honourable senators, as a member of the Bureau québécois pour l'Année internationale des personnes âgées, I am extremely pleased to speak to you today to draw your attention to an event that is very dear to my heart.  In this the International Year of Older Persons, at my suggestion, Canada Post and the Royal Canadian Mint have chosen to mark the contribution of our seniors by issuing a special commemorative coin and stamp, respectively, to mark this special occasion.  As the years go by, the proportion of seniors in the world is going to rise from one person in fourteen to one in four. The United Nations felt it was important to mark a demographic change of this magnitude. The special designation of this year is part of the UN's International Plan of Action on Ageing.  Today's senior citizens have many more options. For many, retirement is now the beginning of something new.  Older people have specific concerns about health care and personal safety, and there is the need, which seniors share with all citizens, for dignity and respect.  In this International Year of Older Persons, we hope to improve understanding, harmony and mutual support among the generations. We wish to enhance appreciation of the invaluable contribution older persons have made to our families, our communities and our country. We want to see our society react to population ageing and diversity in this rapidly changing world.  Throughout 1999, a wide range of organizations and individuals of all ages will be taking part in activities celebrating older persons and their unequalled contribution to Canadian society.  We will also make a point of honouring the work of such organizations as the Conseil régional des personnes âgées italo-canadiennes, which provides inestimable assistance and services to seniors in the greater Montreal regi

This event came from the efforts and the mind of a well-known author and journalist, Lawrence Martin, three years ago. Since then, the celebration has spread to cities, towns and villages all across Canada, and is intended to encourage people to read, to enjoy books and to express support for our authors.  Honourable senators, in Ottawa we had a launch at Chapters bookstore with Dr. Marianne Scott from the National Library, Dr. Shirley Thomson from the Canada Council, Lawrence Martin, of course, and one of our authors, Brian Doyle.  In Calgary, I was quite impressed when 350 Calgarians gathered to pay homage to the late W.O. Mitchell and to remember his writings. All of us would agree that his words, his humour and his sheer joy in writing and living prompted an affection for him here in our country, as well as an expression of support among his peers that is rare in our cautious Canadian society. He was truly the most eloquent writer of the Prairies.  It is a new collection of his writings. I chose

I know that many honourable senators knew him.  Mr. Vincent was born in England. He finished his education in the United States and joined Canada's department of external affairs, as it was known then, as a diplomat. He had a distinguished career which took him across the world, including most recently to Spain and Andorra where he served as our ambassador. He also served as our high commissioner to Bangladesh and as our ambassador to Burma. He served in the missions of Canada in The Hague and New Delhi.  However, it was during his time as ambassador to Peru that he became a hero. In 1996, Mr. Vincent played a major role in the hostage situation at the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima. We believe his actions saved co

His use of my words may suggest that I share his view that the Senate ought to have a limited role in Bill C-20 - a lesser role than the other place - in evaluating the clarity of any secession question or the validity of any secession vote. However, this is not accurate. The honourable minister knows my position very well because I defined it in a 12-page letter to him more than eight weeks ago.  A casual reading of the minister's speech might suggest that my words serve to support the argument he was making, but a more careful review of the

It was in such a time that Dick Stanbury, then a young, successful Toronto lawyer, an officer and organizer of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, chairman of local hospital and library fund-raising campaigns, already zealous about political organization, with the soul and the conscience of an idealist and a reformer in politics, refined and shaped his ardent advocacy of

Nurses are front-line workers in our health care system. A nurse is often the first person we see when visiting a doctor's office or an emergency room. This new trend is one that registered nurses have long lobbied for, and can be characterized as direct access to nursing services. Direct access means the public can choose a registered nurse as their health care provider without having to go through another professional or having to be admitted to a ho

MAXWELL COHEN, O.C., Q.C. Tributes Hon. Gérald-A. Beaudoin :[ English ] Without any doubt, Maxwell Cohen was one of the great jurists of his generation. He played a lead role in numerous academic, professional, and legal activities. Last year, in August, a colloquium on the "Federalism of Tomorrow" was held at the University of Ottawa. The proceedings of that colloquium will be published in June. I wish to say that Maxwell Cohen was in good part responsible for that colloquium. Maxwell Cohen was a highly talented jurist. His was a long and glorious career.  The Senate Time Allocation for Debate Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :Honourable senators, on two occasions last week I sought, and received, permission from this chamber and from all colleagues on both sides to extend my presentation in excess of the 15 minutes allowed by the rules. I wanted to thank honourable senators once again, and to express my gratitude for that indulgence.  However, over the weekend it struck me that there are many issues - particularly the one with which I was dealing, namely, Senate reform - that require a great deal more than the time allowed. Visitors in the Gallery The Hon. the Speaker :Honourable senators, I should like to draw your attention to the presence in our gallery of a group of visitors. They are a group of 16 students accompanied by four coordinators from the Long Plain First Nations, and they are part of the Long Plain Youth for Tomorrow project.  The group is accompanied by their coordinators Margaret Assiniboine, Mary Wichmartin, Mary Perswain and Robert France. I must add, of course, that they come from that great province of Manitoba.

In July, 1996, General Baril, as head of the army, announced an investigation into misconduct at the mental hospital at Bakovici.

Calvin Woodrow Ruck :At the outbreak of the war, it would appear, a considerable number of RCMP officers decided to change their RCMP uniform for military uniforms. They joined branches of the army, navy and air force. Consequently, that left a rather large vacancy in the ranks of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP officer in charge at the Sydney detachment advertised in the local papers for young, able-bodied men to enlist in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Those two young black men were among the people who wanted to enlist.  The officer in charge in Sydney did not know what to do with these two young black men. At that point in time,

This wonderful poet, novelist and chronicler of the Yukon Territory captured the heart and soul of the land he loved.  When the young Paul Lucier first went to Whitehorse in 1949 from LaSalle, Ontario, he worked on the largest sternwheeler to ply the mighty Yukon River, the S.S. Klondike , now beautifully restored to its original proud stature. He went on to become a fire-fighter, an ambulance driver, a mechanic, a bus driver, a lover of amateur sports, a boxing instructor, and, later, the mayor of Whitehorse.  During a long and devoted service to the Senate of Canada, Paul remained always a man of t

Phillips :Honourable senators, today is a very special day in the life of one of our distinguished colleagues. On February 10, 1964, the Honourable Senator Prud'homme was first elected to the House of Commons in a by-election for the riding of Saint-Denis. He obviously enjoys the party that follows an election victory, because he went on to celebrate eight of those and eventually became dean of the House of Commons. He was sworn to the Privy Council on July 1, 1992, by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the 125th anniversary of the founding of Canada, and he was summoned to the Senate on May 26, 1993 by the Right Honourable Brian Mulroney.  Senator Prud'homme's election in a by-election came about due to the fact that the Honourable Azellus Denis was appointed to this chamber by Lester B. Pearson. Senator Denis sat in the House of Commons for 28 years and almost 28 years in the Senate.  Honourable senators, we can now throw out a challenge to our colleague, namely, that he run again for the House of Commons - I think the election year would be around 2009 or 2008. If he were then to

Stanbury, in the Chair.  Prayers.  THE LATE JOHN M. MACDONALD Tributes Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :Honourable senators, many of you know that Cape Breton is a lovely place of deep valleys and spectacular vistas. Its quiet beauty, mixed with the rich culture and fierce pride of its inhabitants, makes it a place which instils incredible love and loyalty in those fortunate enough to call it home. As a matter of fact, there are those who still insist that there are two kinds of Cape Bretoners: those who were born there and those who wish they were born there. Some people even consider their birth on the island as a personal accomplishment, rather than a biological accident. Having said all of that, you will know that I speak with a lot of pride and just a little bit of prejudice.  Today I rise to pay tribute to one of Cape Breton's most outstanding native sons. One of the greatest tributes I can pay my old friend and colleague is that no man or woman ever bore greater love for Cape Breton; no man or woman ever bore more loyalty to its people than the late Senator John M. Macdonald.  He was buried on June 24, 1997: 37 years to the day he was first called to the Senate by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. If John Macdonald is looking down on us right now - as I am rather sure he is - he is probably having a good laugh at the irony of all that. I visited him personally shortly before he passed away. Tough and razor sharp, even in his final days, he always said he would leave the Senate when they carried him out.  I spent many a day and night in the Sydney airport travelling to and from Ottawa with John M. He was meticulously punctual, arriving as much as two hours before scheduled lift-off. He was easily recognizable by his hat, his slightly stooped figure, his ever-present cane in later years, his sizeable shoes - which will be very hard to fill - and his very determined step.  I am sure he chuckled, too, when the Senate deleg

Prayers.  The Honourable Ron Ghitter, Q.C. Tributes on Departure Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :Honourable senators, while it is never a pleasant task to bid farewell to a colleague who has reached the mandatory retirement age, at least all can prepare for that inevitability. However, when a colleague decides to leave this place voluntarily, and with little warning, the loss is felt even more deeply. This could not be truer than in the case of Senator Ghitter, whose resignation takes effect tomorrow.  I first met Ron in 1976, when we were both active in supporting the same candidate for the leadership of our party. I was struck then by his enthusiasm and dedication - qualities which, among many others, have benefited Parliament for the last seven years, practically to the day, as he was appointed on March 25, 1993. Ron Ghitter brought with him experience and knowledge in law, in business and in politics as a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Not least, he brought here an intense commitment to human rights, which has been marked by prestigious awards from the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews and from the Alberta Human Rights Commission.  Ron's contribution to the Senate has been recognized by all sides because of his clearness of thought and forceful argumentation. His committee participation was highlighted by a most productive and effective term as chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources.  Ron has been particularly valuable in caucus, and all his colleagues will miss his thoughtful interventions. I will miss his loyalty and support.

Prayers.  Nova Scotia Lunenburg Asthma Care Centre Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :The centre has been responsible for reducing the number of emergency room visits, decreasing hospital admissions and shortening patient stays in hospital. Fewer children are missing school and fewer parents are missing work because their children are sick.  Doctors are still trying to determine why.  What distinguishes this centre from others in Halifax, Kentville and Yarmouth is that it is dedicated exclusively to asthma. The prime function of the centre is to teach people how to control their asthma instead of asthma controlling them.  The centre's success is due to its one-on-one patient care, stressing education through self-assessment and self-help. Other centres have self-help groups or videos rather than the one-on-one teaching offered here.  Heart and Stroke Month Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :Honourable senators, February has been designated as Heart and Stroke Month. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, cardiovascular-related diseases kill more than 77,000 Canadians every year. In a world of fast food, high stress, inactivity and smoking, many Canadians fail to recognize that the key to longevity is a healthy heart.  As the baby boomers hit middle age and health care systems struggle with an aging population, heart disease and stroke remain the number one cause of death for Canadians. Cardiovascular disease claims more lives than all the other forms of cancer, respiratory disease and accidents. It is time that we all began to take better care of this vital organ.  In 1998, the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation released a report outlining children's health habits. The findings were startling. The report indicated that children between the ages of six and twelve were already living extremely unhealthy lifestyles. For example, only 20 per cent of Canadian children eat the daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables, while an astonishing 40 per cent of our children eat junk food more than three times a week. These statistics are sobering and indicate a strong likelihood for further health problems.  No longer is heart disease perceived as a ma

For many of us who, in terms of our parliamentary life, grew up on the Hill, Alistair was a figure of wisdom, of humour and of kindness in these corridors. No matter what your party was, he was a symbol of fairness in and out of his important office. He was a mentor and a superb teacher to those of us who were trying to learn the mysteries of parliamentary procedure.  Cheerful in defeat, he then helped advise others in both of our chambers.  He became the Clerk of the House of Commons in our centennial year, after a year as assistant clerk. He

We in Canada live in a free and democratic society. We enjoy freedom of conscience, of religion, of expression, and of association. We have the right to due process and fair trial. People opposed to government are called "critics" and are debated; they are not labelled dissidents, taken away, jailed and tortured, as happens in China.  I am not trying to be sanctimonious. I know that we are not perfect. As an example, the actions of the Prime Minister's Office during the APEC affair showed us that we are not above trampling on the basic human rights of our citizens, regardless of what we say about democrac

Prayers.  The Late Honourable Michael Starr, P.C. Tributes Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :Mr. Starr was born on November 14, 1910, in Copper Cliff, Ontario, near Sudbury.  Like many Canadians of Ukrainian descent in that generation and many generations thereafter, Mr. Starr claimed Ukrainian as his first language before entering school, both parents having come from Ukraine. He started his working life as a clerk in Oshawa and married Anne Zaritsky in 1933. In Oshawa, he was an alderman from 1944 to 1949 and mayor from 1949 to 1952.  Also in 1952, he entered federal politics as a Progressive Conservative member from the Oshawa constituency, which he represented until 1968. He was Minister of Labour from 1958 until 1963 in the John Diefenbaker administration.  Having first served as house leader from 1965 to 1968, he went on to contest the B.C. party leadership in 1967, although unsuccessfully. In 1968, having been defeated in the general election, he went on to serve as a citizenship court judge until 1972 and then as Chairman of the Ontario Workers' Compensation Board from 1973 to 1980.  Mr. Starr is remembered for his work in furthering the cause of ethnic groups and minorities. He helped to build the policy of old age pensions for the Conservative Party. He worked to make the national employment service more humane in its approach to the unemployed and, in his tenure as minister, extended unemployment insurance benefits to women and seasonal workers, and extended federal financial assistance to the provinces under the vocational training coordination act.  While his record of fairness and commitment to public service would be the pride of any parliamentarian, he is best remembered by me and many Canadians of Ukrainian descent as the first Canadian cabinet minister of Ukrainian descent. For his achievement, Mr. Starr was named Ukrainian of the Year for North America in 1957 a

Prayers.  National Unity Hon. Noël A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :Honourable senators, yesterday, our colleague Senator LeBreton reminded us that in 1993 the 24th Prime Minister of Canada resigned. Five years later to the day, thanks to the political leadership of Mr. Mulroney, the Minister of Finance was able to present a balanced budget.  That was possible because of Prime Minister Mulroney's vision, leadership and energetic decision-making. I am thinking most particularly of the implementation of a restructured economic infrastructure and a modern economy, such elements as replacing the sales tax on manufactured goods by the GST, and the free trade agreements. The budget's success is built on those policies.  In the decisions made by Mr. Mulroney, we can see his courage in implementing policies that won him no popularity contests. They were, however, the right decisions for our country's future.  Where national unity is concerned, we see the same quality of leadership. I remember his statement to the members of the Newfoundland House of Assembly: When we look at our children we will think: "Could we have avoided all of this through Meech Lake?" If that night were ever

Jack Austin , Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples, presented the following report: Wednesday, March 29, 2000 The Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples has the honour to present its FOURTH REPORT Your Committee, to which was referred Bill C-9, an Act to give effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, has, in obedience to the Order of Reference of February 10, 2000, examined the said Bill and now reports the same without amendment, but with the observations appended to this report.  Respectfully submitted, to the Fourth Report of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples Your Committee is nevertheless deeply concerned about the implications of outstanding overlap issues, not only in relation to the Nisga'a and neighbouring First Nations, but also in the broader context of the ongoing British Columbia treaty process involving over 50 First Nations. Your Committee therefore strongly urges the federal government and its negotiating partners to pursue vigourously all means at their disposal to ensure that overlap issues are resolved to the satisfaction of concerned First Nations prior to the conclusion of future land claim agreements.  The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  On motion of Senator Austin, bill placed on the Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting of the Senate.

Francis William Mahovlich :Honourable senators, I wish to bring to your attention a visit I made recently to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. On the trip, Canada was represented by members of Parliament and senators. During our meetings, I did not have an opportunity to speak in the debate concerning whether the Russians should be absented from the council or whether they should be allowed to remain. Today, I should like to address the issue.  As recently as December, I spent 10 days in Russia. I found that there have been many changes since I was there in the early 1970s. There are positive signs of new democracy beginning to take shape. The treatment our delegates received was extremely accommodating and far above our expectations. Indeed, one had to wonder when travelling around Moscow whether there was a war going on in Chechnya and whether the people were being informed properly.  I agreed with the views expressed by members of the assembly during that week who stated that terrorism cannot be defeated by behaving like a terrorist. Canada condemns Russian military tactics in this tragic conflict. We condemn putting conscript soldiers at risk for their lives in a war that cannot be won and in which everyone loses. Canada,

Bill Rompkey :Honourable senators, in 1942 Clement Attlee, Britain's wartime Dominion secretary, predicted that without some great discovery of minerals in my province, we were unlikely to afford anything but a modest standard of life. Ironically, today, over 50 years later, as we celebrate the Senate's passing of our Act of Union, it is the richest nickel mine in the world, together with oil, water power and brain power, that can make Newfoundland and Labrador a net contributor to the federation. For those first 50 years we were able to share the bounty of Canada through equalization payments of various kinds, but the day is not far off when we will be able to give more than we receive.  Over those 50 years, we have come to appreciate this country for the majesty of its mountains and valleys, to which my province has contributed the Torngats and Gros Morne; for the powerful beauty of its rivers, to which my province has contributed the Churchill and the Exploits; for the rich heritage of its songs and musicians, to which my province has contributed "I'se the B'y" and "Great Big Sea"; for the acumen of its entrepreneurs, to

Prayers.  The Late Bernie Faloney Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :Honourable senators, Bernie Faloney was an exception. He could not pass, he could not run, he could not kick. He played in nine Grey Cup games, winning in four, and this was accomplished with bowed legs.  Bernie Faloney played in many famous games, including for Edmonton in the 1954 Grey Cup. From 1955 to 1956 he served in the U.S. Air Force. In 1957 he was with the Hamilton Tiger Cats. He did not have the bullet-like passes of Sam "the Rifle" Etcheverry, but they somehow hit their targets. He did not have the power of Lou "the Toe" Grozza, the famous Cleveland punter, but his average was as good as any punt specialist.  One of the greatest moments in sports came in 1961; a sudden death game in Hamilton against the Toronto Argonauts. The score was 25-25. The Argo's star kicker, Dave Mann, was going for the winning single point. The Tiger Cats placed Bernie Faloney in the end zone to kick the ball back. What happened next has been called the greatest moment in sport. Mann's kick only went 10 yards into the end zone. Faloney kicked the ball back. The Argo kicker recovered the ball and sent it flying towards the Tiger Cat end zone.

Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :Honourable senators, when Senator Archibald Johnstone first came to the Senate of Canada a little over a year ago, he described himself as a quiet little guy from Kensington, Prince Edward Island. He also reputedly said that he came here thinking that the Senate was not too effective, and that it was an old people's home for retired politicians. He has pointed out recently that he would like to correct much, if not all, of that earlier impression.  I, too, would like to set the record straight. Senator Johnstone was a crew member with the RCAF heavy bombing squadron during World War II. He went overseas, came back, and became a flight lieutenant, all before the age of 21 - not bad for a quiet little guy from Kensington.  In his evolving career, he served as president of the Prince Edward Island Federation of Agriculture and director of the Island Tourism Association, among other things, as well as enjoying great success in business pursuits of his own over the years.  Archie met his old friend Orville Phillips in the Air Cadets. Orville Phillips, as many of our colleagues know, was another quiet little guy from the Is

John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :Honourable senators, I doubt if anyone here was surprised that media reports of last week's decision by the Senate to suspend one of its members gave priority to the fact that a number of senators were absent when the vote was taken. This allowed our flourishing cottage industry in Senate-bashing to renew its campaign to convince Canadians that the only criterion for evaluating the contribution of senators is the number of times they are present in the chamber. Attendance is attainment; absence is abdication.  In the minds of these Senate pit bulls, whose excessive rhetoric is surpassed only by their ignorance of the workings of this place in particular, and of Parliament in general, tally sheets of attendance form the sole valid record by which one is to be evaluated. As a result, none of us is immune from the wrath of these misguided parliamentary purists, whose pocket calculators at this very moment are no doubt updating our attendance records.  Take Senator Doyle, for instance. During his time here, the Senate will have sat 902 times, and he will

Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :Honourable senators, the Leader of the Government in the Senate is absent today. However, should honourable senators wish to put questions, I would be happy to take them as notice.  Business of the Senate Hon. Lowell Murray :Honourable senators, I have a question that the Deputy Leader of the Government might be able to answer. In view of the motion we just passed to the effect that the Senate will meet again on Tuesday at two o'clock, may we expect as heavy a legislative menu next week as we have had this week?  Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :Honourable senators, I wish to thank the Honourable Senator Murray for that question. I believe that we will be receiving at least two bills this week.  Senator Murray :Two? That is amazing.  Senator Hays :We have a heavy committee workload, which I hope will be made heavier today as a result of our deliberations. In fact, I fully expect that there will be considerable work done today, at least if all goes according to plan.  We are anticipating some very important legislation. ORDERS OF THE DAY Royal Assent Bill Second Reading-Debate Continued On the Order: Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :Honourable senators, earlier, in a conversation with the Deputy Leader of the Government, I had indicated that I would not be speaking on Bill S-7. After further reflection, I changed my mind.  I shall do so more or less off the cuff, because I did not have the time I would have liked to have had to prepare a text. I have even felt pressured from certain quarters to hurry up and speak on this bill. And yet, we are only on the third day.

Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :Honourable senators, I was examining the Debates of the Senate yesterday, and my eyes fell upon the date of October 4, 1995. I thought honourable senators would like to be reminded of what occurred at that time.  Senator Bryden, on that day, stated: Honourable senators, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that while most of you were enjoying a well-earned summer break, Senator Simard and I were engaged in a somewhat partisan contest in the province of New Brunswick. During that time, in his own inimitable fashion, Senator Simard referred to Frank McKenna and I as two puppies who had made a mess and should have our noses rubbed in it.  I was reminded of that reckless position on September 11. The people of New Brunswick presented us with a beautiful bouquet of 48 red roses. The premier and I rubbed our noses in them and the fragrance will stay with us for the next four years.  Senator Bryden :Good stuff!  Senator Lynch-Staunton :Who is the florist?

Oliver :Honourable senators, 30 years ago the Kerner Commission in the United States reported that America was in danger of becoming two societies - "one black, one white; separate and unequal."  This month, the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation reported that the Kerner Commission's predictions have been realized. The structural, vertical gaps are widening despite the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education .  Honourable senators may wonder what this has to do with Canada. Unless our nation provides equality of opportunity to all Canadians - rich and poor, black and white, French and English - we stand to repeat the mistakes of America. You will find the education that is provided to be of unequal quality. The inner city areas will not

It was an evening that attracted some 200 people, of whom a dozen or so were asked to share their thoughts and appreciation or, as such events tend to encourage, their lack of appreciation of the guest of honour.  Three senators were among the numbers present that evening. I certainly hope that if the other two speak today, they will not find as inhibiting as I do this adjustment from the freedom allowed by the "off the record, let it all hang out" concept of that event to the "everything you say here will be recorded fo

Wilson :Honourable senators, Ontario intends to stream the coming swell of college and university students away from the humanities and social sciences and into computer, engineering, medical research, and communications courses. To achieve this, the Ontario government launched last week a $1.4-billion building program, the largest investment in post-secondary education in a generation, lavishing funds on high-tech courses at major universities and colleges while starving the liberal arts and smaller schools that focus on them. Institutions in Toronto will receive more than half of the new funding. Universities that have heavy emphasis on liberal arts programs - Brock, Trent, Windsor, Nipissing - will receive not a penny.  There are still those who believe in the value of a liberal arts degree, even in the workforce, and I am such a one. A Globe and Mail editorial today suggests that those who want liberal arts education get to work and establish private liberal arts universities, even if some of us oppose that idea on principle and even if that community is not nearly as we

It is with much pride that we wish Colleen Jones and her team good luck as Canada's representatives in the World Curling Championship to be hosted by Saint John, New Brunswick, April 3 to 9 next.  There were other winners this past weekend: the hosts of this remarkably successful championship - the people of Prince Edward Island. Our congratulations also go to the more than 1,000 volunteers who pulled together in Charlottetown to make this Scott Tournament of Hearts - one of Canada's most prestigious sporting events - such a huge success.

The awards have become a Canadian showcase of talent and career achievements of our aboriginal people. The National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation has delivered over $5 million in education assistance to over 800 aboriginal youth in Canada.  Recipients of the 1998 National Aboriginal Achievement awards are as follows: Buffy St. Marie won for lifetime achievement.

She has received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Regina and she is currently teaching art at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College.  John Amagoalik won for public service. As Chief Commissioner of the Nunavut Implementation Commission, John is responsible for the single greatest restructuring of the Canadian political system since Confederation.

In fact, he had learned a little English working as a waiter on a RAF base in northeast Italy.

I know a number of senators have urgent matters to discuss. Please discuss them outside the chamber so that we can hear those who are in the chamber and who wish to speak.  Senator LeBreton :Thank you, Your Honour. Perhaps my honourable friends did not want to hear this.  A quick read of the book reveals a decided Liberal bias. I set it aside as there are only so many Liberal windmills that one can tilt at. That ended when I read this morning's Ottawa Citizen .  Honourable senators, what is going on around here? Why is it that the chairman and staff of the NCC would hold a "private briefing" for Liberal MPs in the National Capital Region? Does no one else count? Only when one of the MPs talked to the media did the NCC quickly release some of the details to The Ottawa Citizen .  The book should have been more properly named, "A Place for Liberals, A Story of the NCC." May I remind the NCC of its mandate statement, which is listed on the Government of Canada Info Source Web site and states: The NCC carries out its mandate under authority of the National Capital Act.

Atkins :Honourable senators, I should like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Senate to the sixtieth anniversary of Canada's entry into the Second World War on September 10, 1939. While we were 10 days late with a formal declaration of war, the war having started with the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, we had already started our preparation to halt Nazi aggression and to join our Commonwealth allies in the pursuit of victory.  Canada's military was small at the outset of war. The Royal Canadian Navy possessed some River Class destroyers and had less than 2,000 sailors. The Canadian Army permanent force had 4,200 men backed up by 51,000 militia. We were, however, a determined people, and Canadians from all walks of life came forward to save humanity from tyranny.  It was to be a war of great sacrifice. The defeats at Dunkirk, Dieppe and Hong Kong filled all Canadians with a resolve to win, and win we did, along with our allies.  Victory, in the

Prayers.  SENATORS' STATEMENTS The Senate Yesterday's Attendance Hon. Marie-P. Honourable senators, I am pleased to see some members of the press in the gallery today. As chair of the Senate Liberal caucus, as a member of the Senate and as a former broadcaster, I welcome and appreciate the interest that is being shown in our work.  As we know, there are 104 seats in the Senate of Canada. Currently, four are vacant. Out of 100 sitting senators, 75 were in the chamber yesterday while 11 were holding hearings as members of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. That is, 86 senators out of 100 were present, an 86 per cent attendance rate. That is not the 60 per cent rate indicated by some journalists this morning. I thought I would set the record straight.  Telecommunications Rogers Cablevision-Unjustified Raise in Service Charges Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :Honourable senators, I am grappling with an illness that it takes time to cure, but the time will come.  I would first like to thank all of you who through your expressions of sympathy, by letter, by telephone or in person, have helped me through these very difficult years.  This disease, which has had me in its grip for nearly two years, seems to be under control. As you can see, there have been improvements. The point of my remarks today, honourable senators, is to make you aware of a situation I consider unjustifiable and unacceptable.  Rogers Cable is going to impose unacceptable rate hikes on all its subscribers. This is an unjustified increase in service charges.  In order to put a better face on things, Rogers will suspend this increase for a year if the subscriber signs up for a new group of channels which the company has dubbed MeTV. Rogers loses absolutely nothing in the deal.  As you know, the Rogers monopoly is currently experiencing serious financial difficulties and it hopes to overcome those difficulties by imposing an additional charge on taxpayers.  You will note as well that there will be only one French-language channel in this MeTV package, Canal famille.  I have written to Ted Rogers as well as to Françoise Bertrand, the Chairman of the CRTC, to pro

The Hon. the Speaker :As there is no business before the Senate, is it your pleasure, honourable senators, that the Senate do now adjourn during pleasure to await the arrival of His Excellency the Governor General?  The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Prayers.  Human Rights in Tibet Fortieth Anniversary of Uprising Against the Occupying Chinese Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :Honourable senators, almost a half century ago, a dark cloud descended over the top of the world. The leadership of the newly formed People's Republic of China decided to annex the peaceful, unprepared and independent country of Tibet. Following the invasion of Tibet by the Chinese army, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, then a very young man, along with his advisors, tried to live with their oppressors. However, the actions of the Chinese army, which included torture, executions, destruction of religious property and a growing presence of troops throughout the country, made this impossible.  Forty years ago today, on March 10, 1959, the Tibetan people once again rose up in defence of their culture, their freedom, their religion and their homeland. This revolt was brutally crushed. Thousands were killed and thousands more maimed. Families were torn apart, schools and monasteries were sacked and burned, and the world stood idly by and watched. In the midst of the turmoil and chaos, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and a group of supporters fled their homeland. With little bu

Prayers.  SENATORS' STATEMENTS Health Medical Research Council-Effects of Reduction in Funding Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :Honourable senators, I should like to draw your attention to the seriousness of the current situation facing the Canadian health research sector.  As many of you know, the Medical Research Council has provided stability, reliability, continuity and standards in support of basic, applied and clinical health research in this country since 1960. Every day in laboratories, hospitals, clinics and universities, Canadian researchers, supported by the MRC, are engaged on the frontiers of both pure science and practical innovations in health care. These researchers are generating contributions to knowledge and care that will help improve the lives of people everywhere.  Since 1994, however, the Medical Research Council's budget has been reduced by 13 per cent, from approximately $266 million in 1994-95 to $221 million in 1998-99. An increasing number of proposals that would normally have received support are being rejected because of insufficient funding.  Honourable senators, I want to try to put in perspective the significance of the impact of reductions in the field of health research. At the outset, it is important for all of us to remember that investments in health research generate both social and economic benefits for society.  The economic bene

It has been 27 years since the "Series of the Century" in 1972, when the world stopped for a moment to witness Canada's great win. Now, as then, there are political overtones. Our trip was organized mainly by Mr. Alexander Tikanov, who will be running for governor of the area. Mr. Tikanov is not only a political whiz but also has more Olympic and sports medals than any of our senators.  The purpose for my trip was to witness firsthand the changes in Moscow and Russia since 1972 and to play the rubber match we won in 1972 and lost in 1974. The team consisted of Hall of Famers Guy Lafleur and his son, Gilbert Perreault and his son, Marcel Dionne, Steve Shutt and Brad Park. Goaltender Richard Savigny and Gaston Gingras helped fill up the roster, along with others, including my son Ted Mahovlich.  To summarize the match, Guy Lafleur was outstanding in game number one, scoring a hat trick. The father-son combination of Frank and Ted Mahovlich scored with minutes to go in the second game, and Frank was voted the star of the game!  Hon. Senators :Hear, hear!  Senator Mahovlich :The trophy will be displayed in my office.  I did not get
